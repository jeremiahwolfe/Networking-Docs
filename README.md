# Networking-Docs

I am atempting to create a repository of configuration examples and template files for my career as a network engineer.  
While I have always used template files in my career, today's market requires that engineers be profecient in numerous  
vendors and technologies, far more than what was required of engineers in the past.

In many ways this skill expansion is absurd. No one, not even the best engineers can be simultaniously functionally proficient in so  
many technologies, protocols, platforms, and tools from so many vendors.

Hopefully this repository...should my goal actually bear fruit...will help with these modern demands.
